# Introduction to Node JS and NPM

## What is Node JS?

- Node JS is an open source and cross platform JS runtime environment.
- Node js runs on V8 JS engine, the core of google chrome, outside of the browser. This allows Node.js to be performant.
- Using Node JS we are going to create a server and communicate with database.

### When you install Node JS it installs npm and npx too

- npm - Node Package Manager - installs the package first and then in your program/File
- npx - Node Package Executor - It installs only your project folder.
